This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Intro
Using this repo to learn and practice new Next.js feature, which include:
- Server actions
- useOptimistic hook

## Details
- Server actions
    They allow us to make server mutations inside the next js app.
- useOptimistic
    Thus hook is used to make optimistic updates to in our app. Can be used to make use experience more reponsive and improve the UX.
    Using it the UI updates are instant when the server action is invoked without having to wait for the action reponse.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
